# Open Source Nintendo Image Shrinker

Several image shrinkers already exists, why write yet another one?  Well, none of them are open source and it can be very hard to find out any information about them or to collaborate on them.  I very much want hurunken image support in Nintendont and USBLoaderGX so I decided to create my own.

## Design notes

Gamecube/Wii discs seem to work on a sector size of 0x8000(32,768) bytes

### Here is some useful information about various Nintendo iso images

GC ISO 0x57058000(1,459,978,240) bytes
44,555(0xAE0B) sectors
356,440 byte, 11 sector pt

Wii Single Layer ISO 0x118240000(4,699,979,776) bytes
143,432(0x23048) sectors
1,147,456 byte, 36 sector pt

Wii Dual Layer ISO 0x1FB4E0000(8,511,160,320) bytes
259,740(0x3F69C) sectors
2,077,920 byte, 64 sector pt

### Here is my proposed format to describe a shrunken gamecube/wii image with an optimization towards random access/lookup
If we use a single block of size 0x40000 bytes as a table to describe our shrunken image and if the largest image (a dual layer wii image) has 32,468 blocks then each block can have 8 bytes available to describe it within our table.

#### Each block in our full image will be described by an 8 byte section in our table

#### The first 8 byte section will just be a magic number to identify a shrunken image
00-07 'O','S','N','I','S',0xXX,0xYY,0xZZ
0xXX is a version number, I'm starting at 0 for development and when there is a viable working algorithm I'll up it to 1
0xYY is image type where 0x01 = GC, 0x10 = WII, and 0x11 is a Dual Layer WII
0xZZ is the number of sectors of the partition table

Each sector in our full image will be described by an 8 byte section in our table

#### Each additional section will describe a block of data
* Data block
  * 00-03 block number where it can be found in the shrunken image
  * 04-07 CRC32 of the data block
* Generated junk block - a block of junk generated by the fancy algorithm.
  * 00-03 0xFF,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF
  * 04-07 CRC32 of the junk block
  * The algorithm creates a unique deterministic block of junk given the discId, block number, and disc number.  Since it is completely reproducable and atomic this information can be recreated without knowing any other data from the image.
* Repeat junk block - a block of a single uniform repeated byte
  * 00-03 0xFE,0xFE,0xFE,0xFE
  * 00-07 0x00,0x00,0x00,0x?? - the repeated char
* No Data
  * 00-07 0x00
  * Once we see an entry of all 0's we are at the end of our image and can ignore all future blocks, which should also be zero.

This should provide a robust definition of an image that can be used to restore an exact duplicate of the original image as long as the junk generating algorithm is known.  Also, this should be an efficient image for being able to randomly access any given byte of a shrunken image as if it was the original image just by doing a lookup in the table and then either seeking to the location within the shrunken image, or by generating the junk data as necessary.

## Buiding
### Linux
requires gcc

```
make
```
## OSX
requires clang
```
make
```
### Windows
requires windows gcc
```
gcc src\crc32.c src\hash.c src\image.c src\disc_info.c src\main.c -o osnis
```
## USAGE

#### To profile an image
```
osnis -p -i game.iso
```
Also works with stdin
```
cat game.iso | osnis -p
```

#### To shrink an image
```
osnis -s -i game.iso -o game.iso.osnis
```
or with stdout (shrinking takes two passes so no stdin)
```
osnis -s -i game.iso > game.iso.osnis
```

##### To unshrink an image
```
osnis -u -i game.iso.osnis -o game.iso
```
or with stdin and stdout
```
cat game.iso.osnis | osnis -u > game.iso
```

## TODO
1. Make it work on wierd one off images that I don't know much about yet
2. Play arround with different block sizes to see if that improves shrinkage
3. Figure out why WII images don't shrink as much as they should
4. Update Nintendont and Dolphin to be able to read these images natively
